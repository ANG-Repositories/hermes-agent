# SCHEDULE: manual (operator / one replay card runs it against the live board, read-only)
"""Replay the last N days of kanban placements under Studio default-deny (t_062a5948). Read-only, stdlib only.

For every run that STARTED on the Mac Studio (``placement`` event whose host is the Studio), it asks what the rule
(``kanban.placement.studio_default_deny``) would have done with a given allowlist:

  allowlisted   the capability is on the allowlist: runs on the Studio as before
  exempt        operator-only card (operator assignee, or no_worker): runs on the Studio as before
  moves         nothing Studio-only held it (portable last resort, pool-served capability, carried files):
                under t_9965b8d5 + this rule it goes to a pool host; the wait is estimated from the next pool
                placement after it (0 when a pool host had a free slot that tick)
  override      a Studio-only capability (or structural fact) NOT on the allowlist: the card has no host at all
                and waits for an operator ``hermes kanban studio-override`` (one per run with --once)
  unknown       a ``host_studio`` placement, or a review-lane placement, with no ``studio_capability`` record (it
                predates the record): the replay cannot say what held it, so it is neither a move nor an override
                (Prism 9fec6c08b569, c-0d4f28b3daf38893)

Output: a markdown report (per-capability table with proposed keep/deny, the per-day override count, the moved
cards and their estimated waits, and every card that would have been stuck).
