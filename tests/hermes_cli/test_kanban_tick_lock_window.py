"""The board tick lock is held only while the tick decides (t_f60f502f, ``kanban.dispatch.narrow_lock``).

Measured 2026-11-08 on the Studio: one tick held ``kanban.db.dispatch.lock`` 60-300 s, almost all of it in
workspace resolution and spawn after the claim, and ``kanban admit`` was refused for minutes. The tick now
hands the lock back between a claim and the next decision (:class:`kanban_db_connect.TickLockWindow`),
records how long it held it (``DispatchResult.lock_held_s``) and where the time went (``tick_phases_s``).
