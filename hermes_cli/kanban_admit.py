"""``hermes kanban admit <card> --host <host> --reason <why>`` (t_32e8796a, FWA).

An operator-only, per-card admission override. It spawns ONE ready card on ONE
host now, skipping the utilization LoadGate and the host admission band, and
still books the normal reservation so later admissions see the worker.

It runs the dispatcher's OWN ready lane (``kanban_db_dispatch.admit_once`` ->
``_dispatch_once_locked`` restricted to this card and this host) with exactly
one gate off, host admission. Routing/eligibility, the board budget, the pause
hold, the browser gate, the respawn guard, provider admission, the lane-model
override, workspace admission, the claim and the guarded launch are the tick's
own code, so a gate added to the tick binds admit too (Apollo r5).

The pool plan is the dispatcher's own (``GateTickBuilder.build_pool_plan``:
pool files, signal, the real probe with ``kanban.workspaces_root``); None when
the pool refuses, exactly as a tick with no plan (Apollo r7). The forced host is
checked against the card's FINAL route, after the pause hold and browser gate.

What stays here: the operator token (``KANBAN_OPERATOR_TOKEN`` equal to the
board's ``operator-token`` file), the kill switch ``kanban.admin_admit.enabled``,
the canonical host name, the floor callable and the ``admission_override``
event payload. The dispatcher runs the floor INSIDE its tick lock right before
take/claim, so the measurement it judges is the one the launch uses (Prism
84845601b3b9).

The floor is the canonical FWA predicate, ``fleet_placement.admission.admit()``,
never a private threshold (Ace msg 1569308234441949345 "only fwa is the
guard/gate"; msg 1569529863298359387: no consumer-side vetoes). The override
contract: admit runs that predicate with ``cpu_saturable=True``, the predicate's
own switch that makes the CPU line a score penalty instead of a refusal. That is
the host admission band admit exists to override. Every other axis stands
exactly as FWA prices it: memory available after the host table's
``mem_reserve_gb`` (subtracted once, inside ``admit()``), the live leases of
every consumer on the host, this card's measured estimate, PSI mem/io, process
slots, the SLO guard, and an unmeasured or unreadable input refuses (fail
closed). There is no load1 bar and no memory floor of admit's own.

There is no bulk form, no ``--max`` and no reordering: the 09-29 load-243
incident was a bulk override (t_689b81b7). Every admission writes an
``admission_override`` event naming the actor, host, reason and the band +
headroom it overrode.
