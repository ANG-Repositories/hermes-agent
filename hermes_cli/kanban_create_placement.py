"""The one ``placement:`` line ``kanban create`` prints: where the card will run, and which line decided it.

Card t_0a5740f3. Ace 2026-11-11 (Discord 1570197131329937549): kanban workers stay off the Mac Studio
unless truly necessary. Before this the author saw nothing at mint time, and the first sign of a Studio
placement was the placement event after the spawn.

The route is the dispatcher's own (:func:`kanban_db_dispatch._route_row`) for the card as it now stands,
computed from the pool files and the capability map. It does not know this tick's load, slots or probe
results, and it does not know links added later. So the line says where the card goes, not when. Binds are read
dry-run and no placement event is written. The one write a dropped bare ``host: studio`` pin can make is the
dispatcher's own once-per-card notice (``kanban_studio_pin.note_drop``), which the first tick would write anyway.
Never raises: on any error there is no line.
