"""Workspace carry with no size cap, off the dispatcher tick (t_f3a411c2; Ace 2026-11-12 09:25 "no cap").

Before this, ``kanban_worker_hosts.carry_workspace`` copied a local_files card's Studio scratch dir to the pool host
INSIDE the dispatcher tick, so ``CARRY_MAX_BYTES`` / ``CARRY_MAX_ENTRIES`` bounded the tick and a bigger dir made the
card wait. Here the tick only STARTS the carry (a background thread) and moves on; the card waits
``carry_pending:<host>`` and is claimed on a later tick once the copy has finished. Nothing is capped by size.

The carry, in order (all in the background thread):

1. census: bytes and entries of the source (no cap, no wall bound) and, in the same walk, every git checkout in it.
   A checkout whose git dir would not travel as files (``carried_gitdir_loss``: a linked worktree of a repo outside
   the workspace, a clone borrowing objects through alternates) is REBUILT on the pool host from origin plus one git
   bundle (see "checkouts whose git dir does not travel" below), never refused for it;
2. the destination is prepared (the same mkdir every placed run gets) and its free space read; ``need > free`` is the
   one size refusal left: ``No room on <host>: need N, free M``;
3. ``rsync -a --partial --delete`` over fleet ssh into a STAGING dir next to the workspace (``.carry-<leaf>``), never
   into the workspace itself (the rebuilt checkouts excluded, then rebuilt inside it). An interrupted copy leaves only the staging dir, which the next attempt on that host
   resumes; a later carry to another host removes it first.

At the claim the staging dir is moved onto the workspace path in one ssh call (``finalize``), and the existing
``workspace_carried`` event is written, so the card binds to that host as before. The Studio copy is not touched.

Events on the card: ``workspace_carry_started`` / ``workspace_carry_progress`` (at most one a minute) /
``workspace_carry_failed`` (``state``: clean | resumable | refused) / ``workspace_carried`` (with bytes, entries,
seconds and the CPU the Studio paid).

A one-shot tick (CLI dispatch, admit: no ``defer``) holds the board tick lock throughout, so it copies inline only a
dir within the old caps, each copy step under CARRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS; a bigger one waits for the gateway's tick.

Kill switch: ROOT ``kanban.placement.carry_caps: true`` restores the in-tick carry and its two caps exactly.
