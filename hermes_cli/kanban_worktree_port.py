"""Worktree cards on pool hosts: clone from origin + the host's git mirror.

A ``--workspace worktree:`` card used to be Studio-only (``portable()`` rule
``workspace_kind``): its checkout is a linked worktree of a Studio repo. When
the repo has a mirror on a pool host (``/srv/ci/git-mirrors/*.git`` on
ci-box / ace-ai / ace-media), the card can run there instead (t_6d9e7d90):
the dispatcher clones origin into the card's scratch path on that host with
the mirror as ``--reference --dissociate`` (~13 s for hermes-home on
ci-box), checks out the card's branch (``wt/<id>`` unless set), and converts
the card to ``scratch`` at that path. Every rerun binds to that host
(:func:`ported_host`, independent of ``placement.continuation``). Remote GC
(``kanban_survivor.remove_workspace_dir`` remote path) deletes the clone
only when it is clean and every local commit is on a remote, so unpushed
work is held, never collected.

Which repos: ``<fleet>/kanban-worktree-mirrors.json`` (schema 1)::

    {"schema": 1, "repos": {"ANG-Ventures/hermes-home":
        {"mirror": "/srv/ci/git-mirrors/hermes-home-mirror.git",
         "hosts": ["ci-box", "ace-ai", "ace-media"]}}}

Absent / unreadable / malformed file = no repo ports (fail closed; the card
stays Studio-local as before). That file is the kill switch: drop a row.

Only an ANCHOR worktree ports (``workspace_path`` unset, or naming a repo
root): a concrete target path is a place on the Studio someone chose. A card
whose ``.worktrees/<id>`` already exists on the Studio keeps it (that tree
may hold a prior run's work).

DERIVED mode (t_1d2c5939, default; ``KANBAN_MIRROR_DERIVED=0`` or a file
``"derived": false`` restores the hand list above): every GitHub repo a card
anchors on ports to EVERY pool host; there is no per-repo allowlist. The
file is only an override: schema 2 ``{"schema": 2, "pins": [{"repo": slug,
"hosts": [host, ...], "why": "..."}], "mirror_paths": {slug: path | {"*":
path, host: path}}}`` (schema 1 rows are still read as mirror paths; their
``hosts`` are ignored). ``pins`` ships EMPTY (Ace 2026-11-10, t_20fa16c7): a
row is an explicit operator choice of named hosts, never a default. The
retired ``exclude`` list and a malformed row are ignored with one loud log
line, never a silent Studio pin. A repo with no mirror path uses
``~/.hermes/mirrors/<owner>/<repo>.git`` on the host; the clone is
``--reference-if-able``, so an absent mirror is a slower clone, never a
refusal. A card branch with commits origin lacks is PUSHED at spawn
(``--force-with-lease``) and then ported (:func:`push_card_branch`). A card
whose own Studio tree (``.worktrees/<id>``, a prior run's too, t_20fa16c7)
is dirty ports as well: its changed files ride the clone's ssh call as a tar
(t_894be273, :func:`carry_payload`); nothing uncommitted is pushed anywhere,
and the Studio tree is left as it is. A tree off its branch whose HEAD
contains the branch has that HEAD pushed as the card branch tip.
The reasons a GitHub worktree card may still stay on the Studio are
:data:`LOCAL_ONLY_REASONS`, each with its justification;
``scripts/check_worktree_local_reasons.py`` fails CI on any other.

# skips the card (:func:`clone_busy`), and the synchronous clone refuses to start under it
