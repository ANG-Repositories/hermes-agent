"""PLACEMENT blocks: a worker that ran on the wrong host blocks, the dispatcher re-routes it (t_a32116ec).

A ``kind=capability`` block on a run the pool placed on a remote host is a placement fault, not a
human question: the worker found that the host lacks what the card needs (a Studio shell, the vault,
fleet ssh, the lander). On 2026-10-13, 30 such cards sat ``blocked`` for 1-176 h (t_9a038e36 26 h
while the live tree drifted to ahead=429), each saying "re-run on the Studio" to nobody.

Each tick, for every ``blocked``/``capability`` card whose latest block ended a run that carried a
``worker_placed`` event (or whose reason names a host pin), the dispatcher:

* re-routes it ONCE: prepends a ``host:`` pin line to the body (the same pin an operator writes, so
  :func:`kanban_worker_pool.resolve_pin` honours it and the body shows why) and unblocks it with a
  comment. The target is the host a ``host: <x>`` line in the reason names, else the Studio (the
  dispatcher's own machine, which holds every Studio-only resource);
* records ``placement_unroutable`` ONCE when it cannot: the named host is not an enabled pool host,
  is the host that already failed, the card carries an operator pin to another host, or a re-routed
  run blocked again. kanban-placement-watch (hermes-home) pages #alerts through episode_pager once
  per card on that event, and flags any placement block older than 60 min with neither event.

:func:`classify` is THE classifier; the watch imports it, never re-implements it.
