"""The ``requires:`` line a child inherits from its parents, and the stored-body check (t_1aea9763).

``create_task`` used to append every hard declared word of every parent to the child's body as one
bare ``requires: <words>`` line, after the caller's body had passed hermes-home's
studio-requires-reason check. On 2026-11-12 that append wrote 53 of the board's 107 bare
``requires: studio-state`` lines, and held cards like t_7dabb879 off every pool host.

1. A Studio-only word (served by no pool host: :func:`kanban_studio_capability.studio_only`, the
   set the home hook's ``studio_only_caps`` computes) is not inherited. A child that does need the
   Studio fails fast on a pool host and is re-routed with a reason. Other hard words inherit as
   before. ``--continues`` is unchanged: its card inherits every word, and the line says where it
   came from so the stored-body check accepts it.
2. :func:`stored_refusal` runs the same studio-requires-reason verdict on the body ``create_task``
   is about to INSERT, after every append. Same kill switch (``STUDIO_REQUIRES_REASON=0``), same
   fail-open on a missing hook module.
