"""Who holds (or just held) the SQLite write lock on state.db.

Two sources: ``/proc/locks`` for the holder at this instant (Linux only), and a holder-side ledger
every SessionDB writer keeps for its own long holds, which still names a holder that released just
before a waiter's deadline and works on macOS.

The "database is locked for over Ns" failure names the victim but not the holder, and the
open-descriptor scan (``hermes_state_holders``) cannot tell a reader from the one writer: every
Hermes process has the DB open. SQLite's unix VFS takes ``fcntl`` byte-range locks whose offsets
encode the lock kind, and the kernel exports them with the owning pid, so the holder can be named
at the moment the deadline passes.
