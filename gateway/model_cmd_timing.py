"""Per-stage wall time of one typed ``/model`` (``/m``) command: one INFO line per command (t_7fe48f0b).

An idle-session ``/m opus-d`` took ~79 s on 2026-11-09 while ``switch_model()`` alone took 0.09 s warm
and 3.6 s cold; nothing said where the rest went. The handler marks each stage boundary with
:func:`phase` (one line per boundary, so the long handler body is not re-indented); the time from one
boundary to the next belongs to the earlier phase; ``confirm`` includes adapter delivery::

    PHASE=model_cmd session=<key> outcome=ok save=ok lock_wait_s=0.000 config_s=0.002 ...
        record_s=4.210 record_get_session_s=0.020 record_update_model_s=4.100 ... reply_s=0.090 total_s=4.300

The reply goes out before the save (t_2ab07928), so the line is logged when the save settles, not
at delivery: ``reply_s`` is the time to the confirmation, ``total_s`` the time to the settled save,
``save`` its outcome (ok / failed / interrupted / not_run, ``-`` when nothing was switched).
Phases are exclusive and sum to ``total_s - other_s`` (``other_s`` = time outside any phase: before
the first one and between delivery and the first save stage). ``record_s`` is derived: the sum of
the ``record_*`` phases, one per DB/store call. ``durable_*`` fields are nested spans inside
``record_durable`` (config write, override clear, override write-through) and are not added again.
A phase the command never reached prints ``-``.
Telemetry only: every entry point swallows its own errors, so it can never change the reply.
