# SCHEDULE: manual (CI lint, suite admission_tests; operators run it with --update after moving a decider)
"""admission-decider-lint: refuse a NEW place that decides "may this work start on host H now" outside the ONE
admission library (t_e5124426; same shape as the reserved-lane lint of t_a115fc8a).

The library is scripts/lib/admission.py (admit / admit_class), scripts/lib/admission_demand.py and
scripts/lib/placement.py (may_start / choose / admit, which call it). Any other tracked script that compares a host
load metric to a threshold (cpu_busy, load1/load5, procs_running, runnable_ewma, occupancy, PSI cpu, load_ratio,
getloadavg, ncpu // N) is a candidate private admission rule. The ones that existed when this lint landed are
grandfathered in fleet/admission-decider-baseline.json with their hit COUNT (most are pagers, watchdogs and
forensics, not deciders; the inventory plans/2026-10-27_unified-admission-INVENTORY.md classifies them). The lint is
a ratchet:
  * a file NOT in the baseline with any hit             -> FAIL (route the decision through placement.may_start /
                                                            admission.admit_class, or, for a monitor that never
                                                            gates work, add `# admission-lint: not-a-decider <why>`
                                                            on the line)
  * a baselined file whose hit count GREW               -> FAIL (same remedy)
  * a baselined file whose count shrank / that is gone  -> FAIL until the SAME PR lowers the baseline (--update
                                                            rewrites it down, never up), so a removed decider
                                                            cannot silently grow back into its old allowance
  * --base-ref SHA (CI on a PR): the baseline itself may only go DOWN against the PR base. A row added or raised
    is refused unless the base TREE already carried that many hits in that file (recording code that is already on
    main, never new code); a widened `library` or narrowed `scan` is refused; no baseline at base = a repo's first
    baseline, allowed.

One lint, four repos (t_22955b73): hermes-home owns it; fleet-ops-scripts, prism-router and hermes-agent vendor it
byte-identical under .github/router-core/ (PIN.json) with their own fleet/admission-decider-baseline.json. A baseline
may carry `scan` (dirs, "." = whole tree); `library` is required (repo paths of that repo's admission library copy).
Absent scan uses hermes-home's defaults below. scripts/admission-decider-census.py sums the four baselines into one line.

  admission-decider-lint.py [--root DIR] [--update] [--base-ref SHA]

Count comparison operator occurrences, not statements. Literal metric keys count conservatively.
Comments do not count; non-comparison load sizing shapes remain candidates.
