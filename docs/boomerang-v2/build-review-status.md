# Parent routing build checkpoint

Task: t_99abe991. Historical receipts below are checkpoint evidence, not approval for landing or activation. The correction-round section supersedes earlier acceptance claims.

## Executed evidence

- Base route matrix: 3 failed / 5 passed; inherited summary/fork/branch incorrectly selected worker-model. Explicit child and ordinary controls passed.
- Cold-parent base probe attempted global credential resolution instead of its supplied session resolver and failed with no configured global provider.
- Routing/fork matrix checkpoint: 55 passed in 43.88s.
- Existing persisted-session/channel suites: 15 passed in 10.66s.
- Existing ordinary fallback matrix: 29 passed in 9.13s.
- Latest HTTP checkpoint: 10 passed in 31.59s. Synthetic primary and same-provider rung returned quota 429; cross-vendor SSE returned the unique expected nonce. Includes actual run_entry wrapper with executor/delivery mocked, canonical SessionStore cold resolution, active fallback, empty-policy primary-only failure, in-process detached JSON reconstruction and two boundary mutants.
- Actual credential-sync writer plus route matrix/eligible-fork subset: 20 passed in 11.23s.
- Final targeted mixed/explicit per-task replay, actual credential-sync and bounded snapshot wait: 5 passed, 18 deselected in 3.86s. Import-at-collection corrected a local bootstrap/home-I/O guard fixture error before this receipt.

Runnable narrow checks (sanctioned test-gate; local fallback only when remote admission is unavailable):

    ~/.hermes/scripts/test-gate python3 -m pytest -q tests/tools/test_boomerang_parent_routing.py tests/gateway/test_boomerang_parent_routing.py
    ~/.hermes/scripts/test-gate python3 -m pytest -q -s tests/integration/test_boomerang_parent_routing_http.py

HTTP cases enforce 30-second alarms; bound the execution process to 180 seconds externally, excluding test-gate placement queue time.

## Independent review disposition

1. Explicit recovery credentials bypass: accepted, bypass now checks persisted route_source; selected per-task route also recorded.
2. Mixed batch child-0 route contamination: accepted, selected route and effective fallback recorded on each child/task, including ordinary and explicit children. Both-order and explicit replay checks passed in the final targeted receipt.
3. Credential refresh snapshot race: accepted, refresh/adoption writers synchronized per agent; actual sync-writer regression passes. Snapshot acquisition bounded to two seconds. Token lookup/client operations still occur under the per-agent lock; no gateway-wide lock is used.
4. Eligible-fork nested override aliasing: accepted, deep copy from captured route snapshot; eligible fork/summary test added.
5. Postconstruction downgrade re-snapshot: accepted, captured route snapshot threaded through recursive rebuild. Dedicated parent-switch downgrade/pin-refused proof remains outstanding.

## Continuation checkpoint (same draft PR #116)

- Endpoint-loss reproduced directly on cc36bb1: `persist_route` omitted selected URL. Selected safe primary endpoint now persists in both actual child metadata and helper records; recovery prefers it over provider default and preserves selected protocol. Credential-bearing URLs fail closed. Eleven persistence cases passed through remote sanctioned gate (ci), 3.17s; direct pre-fix assertion was `selected endpoint lost before recovery`.
- Hermetic HTTP fixture now suppresses unrelated plugin/relay boot and context probes, keeps SQLite registry checks for private new DBs, and shortens the actual retry sleep at both definition and imported call-site seams. Cold first summary alone passed 1 in 8.97s. No deadline increased.
- Real notifier dispatch -> persisted claim -> busy/cold canonical parent -> actual delegate/conversation/fallback -> nonce verdict -> real executor/receipt -> adapter delivery: 3 passed in 62.95s before DB-fixture cleanup. Combined HTTP + auto-dispatch rerun: 13 passed in 73.19s. ALR-shaped primary and same-vendor `/anthropic/v1/messages` each fail; CPA-shaped OpenAI chat/SSE succeeds on `/v1/chat/completions`, with distinct synthetic credentials. This is protocol integration, not vendor availability.
- Actual two subprocess/profile homes use production `_child_main`, profile `.env` credential resolution, persisted task reconstruction and real local HTTP: 1 passed in 28.20s. Each returned its own nonce on its own selected URL/model/key despite changed worker/provider defaults. Plugins/MCP startup and metadata probes are explicitly suppressed by child harness; actual platform launch/supervisor admission is not claimed.
- Historical snapshot-timeout arm held the real lock and sent zero requests, but incorrectly accepted `resurfaced=true`, `resurface_delivered=false` without a pending handback. That was wake loss, not acceptance; corrected below.
- Newly discovered: documented pin-refused summary reconstruction did not exist in this tree (no `pin_refused` code). Implementing narrow explicit relay-503/header refusal propagation and one summary rebuild using captured route; fingerprint/pin-refused constructor tests pending.
- Existing Linux wake hang reproduced: default SessionDB open traverses host `/proc/*/fd` under home-I/O guard. Passing `HERMES_STATE_DELETED_WAL_CHECK=registry` in outer shell is scrubbed by test isolation; set it in the scratch-DB fixture. Prior multi-file run stopped bounded after no result, not called green. Base comparison remains pending.

## Final continuation receipt

All commands use `TEST_GATE_NO_CACHE=1 ~/.hermes/scripts/test-gate /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pytest -o addopts= -q` followed by the named repo-relative files (HTTP also `-s`). Remote venue was ci unless noted. Each tranche is at most three files; no suite guard bypass, production calls, board writes, config changes, merge, deploy or restart.

The persistence red control materialized cc36bb1's routing helper in a separate base archive: 12 failed in 2.44s, including named endpoint-loss assertion, malformed policy before lookup and credential URL refusal. This is not the queued file initially named `persistence-red.log`, which actually ran after the fix; only the direct pre-fix assertion and `persistence-control-red.log` are red evidence.

Regression failures were adjudicated, not waived:
- Existing detached launch tests failed with the same `None` handle / missing env assertions on immutable base 59e169b (2 failed, 1 passed in 17.88s, `base-comparison.log`). Host systemd scope admission returns degraded. Their tests now explicitly inject direct-launch admission while retaining actual Popen, PID-file failure and env assertions. Whole files pass as above.
- Wake setup stalls were captured with a 15s faulthandler: `/proc` scan, then SQLite `_init_schema.executescript` under remote load. Base exact owner-wake node passes remotely and locally. Scratch fixture now retains registry WAL checks without foreign-host fd enumeration. Whole head file passes, no deadline increase.
- Expanded route metadata exposed MagicMock-generated non-configuration objects (deepcopy reached a thread lock). Existing mock parent factories now declare concrete route configuration, including nested orchestration. No production copying guard was weakened; complete ordinary/delegate files pass.
- Both boundary mutants now accept only named routing-contract assertion failures. Fingerprint mismatch and explicit relay `503 + x-pool-pin-refused` rebuild tests switch the live parent mid-construction/request, then require the original model/provider/URL/key/chain and summary context. Refusal controls reject 429, missing header, summary mode and an unpinned request. Pin-refusal transport is injected at the real request method; this is not a relay vendor test.

Sanitized per-case traces are committed at `evidence/continuation-wire-traces.json`. Actual synthetic auth equality is asserted by the tests; credential values are omitted from that published artifact.

## Remaining limitations — retain draft pending parent certification

- Production activation/smoke is intentionally pending; no restart or real provider availability is claimed.
- Independent final-head review/certification belongs to Apollo. Full-tree CI was not run locally; these are named narrow subsystem receipts.
- Detached subprocess proof uses two actual OS processes and the real `_child_main`/record reconstruction/credential resolver, but suppresses plugin/MCP startup and does not certify OS supervisor spawn admission or restart/relaunch exactly-once integration. Two profiles use distinct endpoints/keys/models with explicit disabled chains; cross-vendor traversal is proven separately through automatic wakes.
- Cold session/channel precedence and corruption refusal are separately tested; not every precedence/corrupt-on-disk case has its own full HTTP dispatch row. Actual credential-sync writer concurrency is proven, but decorator-removal mutation coverage for every route writer is not exhaustive.
- Operator commit f4738af4fda2 adds cold `session-rehydrated` provenance. Its independent integration receipt was 15 passed in 31.67s. The prior approval was withdrawn at 8450a69a; it does not apply to the correction head. Production activation remains pending.
- HTTP alarms remain 30s per case; combined integration receipt is below 180s, but test-gate placement time is outside that bound and no independent 180s process-group supervisor is shipped.

No production configuration, runtime tree, tracking board or gateway process was modified.

## Operator-requested correction round (reviewed base 8450a69a)

The six-key scope is corrective, not a new architecture or a production acceptance waiver.

- `1f01758726e8`: endpoint/key mismatch now fails closed before copying or constructing a recovered runtime. Saved endpoints may only use credentials resolved for that endpoint. Named `custom:<name>` references use the existing resolver. The previous provider-default-key plus saved-foreign-URL test was unsafe and replaced. Red assertion: DID NOT RAISE; matching credentials remain accepted and mismatched lookup issues no HTTP request or credential-bearing error.
- `55306c3b0721`: removed automatic pin-refusal summary replacement. A refused first request returns the existing `error` result and normal subtree/registry cleanup; no second child exists outside the dispatcher's cancellation ownership. This deliberately withdraws the earlier automatic-rebuild capability. Constructor-time fingerprint downgrade remains supported.
- `664f668ffaf9`: `_fail` atomically persists the original turn and warning via the existing pending-handback mechanism before terminalizing. Actual snapshot-lock timeout now proves first refusal, pending turn, reconciliation admission exactly once, and cleared obligation. No second delivery subsystem added.
- `b289dfdf1cf2`: owner lookup and profile context entry are inside the dispatch failure boundary. Both injected exceptions now terminalize with the original wake durably pending, rather than escaping the task.
- `beea9b15e31c`: HTTP alarm is a context manager entered before endpoint/session/agent setup; all setup exceptions restore handler/timer. Parent starts as None. The cold-first SDK import occurs at collection to avoid metadata enumeration against guarded home during a test.
- `90de20f8c829`: virtual endpoints require their owning provider: MoA's local facade or a registered external-process ACP profile. Ordinary background ACP/MoA routes traverse durable-spec construction and completion/interrupt tests. HTTP providers cannot impersonate these virtual transports; credential-bearing routes remain refused.

Observed receipts (same repository interpreter; sanctioned `test-gate`, cache disabled):

- Red route/fingerprint/auto tranche: 5 failed, 24 passed in 28.24s. Owner/scope red: 2 failed. These are assertion failures, not setup failures.
- Final HTTP + automatic dispatch + owner/scope tranche: 20 passed in 50.69s.
- Final persistence + fingerprint tranche: 28 passed in 9.54s.
- Entire background-interrupt file plus parent routing matrix: 31 passed in 17.57s.
- Cold summary and setup-exception alone: 2 passed, 9 deselected in 11.38s.
- Two real detached profile subprocesses with endpoint-bound named custom references: 1 passed in 11.35s. A generic OpenAI default key is intentionally insufficient for the saved foreign endpoint; the old detached fixture failed closed after the security fix and was corrected to use a real symbolic reference.

Background CI attribution: job 128679699643 at old head contains three actual 60-second harness failures and three `a detached unit must not run in-process` assertions. The immutable 8450a69a control reproduces that six-node set. The fake child lacked concrete route metadata and MagicMock fabricated values that durable-spec serialization rejected; the fixture now declares the actual route contract. This does not weaken production persistence checks. Other CI dependency-download failures are not counted as passes, and no blind rerun was launched.

`scripts/run_tests.sh` was attempted through the gate and refused by the worker suite policy. The executed commands use `test-gate <repo>/venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -o addopts= <one to three named files>`. Full-tree CI, merge, deployment, restart and real-provider production smoke remain operator-owned and unverified. Production deviations: none.
